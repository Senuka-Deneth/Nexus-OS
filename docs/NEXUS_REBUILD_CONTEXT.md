# Nexus OS — Rebuild Context & Build State

Companion to `.cursor/rules/nexus.mdc`. This file tells you **where the build is now**, **the target
architecture**, and **the order of work**. People Intelligence / operating-layer expansion is specified in
`docs/NEXUS_OPERATING_LAYER_PLAN.md` — do not follow retired blueprint docs. Last grounded against the repo: 2026-07-17
(pre-launch audit — reconciled §2/§4 with the dated decisions in §5, which had drifted out of
sync with the main body for three weeks).

---

## 1. Target architecture (corrected)

The product has three logical units. Each box below is named by what it actually does.

### Core pipeline (deterministic functions + one approval gate)
```
Gmail (live) ─┐
Meta  (next) ─┴─▶ Fetch & Normalize ─▶ Noise Filter ─▶ [conversations]
                 ─▶ Classify (intent·value·churn) ─▶ [leads]
                 ─▶ Draft Reply (GPT-4o + retrieval) ─▶ [reply_drafts]
                 ─▶ Approval Gate (policy: auto low-risk · gate high-stakes)
                 ─▶ Channel Sender (per-platform) ─▶ Customer
```
- On Gmail/Meta connect, run a **60–90 day historical backfill** so the dashboard is never empty.

### Knowledge & insight
- **One `pgvector` store inside Supabase.** Table `embeddings`, tagged by `kind`:
  `business_doc` (founder uploads), `conversation`, `summary`. Switch a kind on only when a
  feature reads it. Business docs first; conversations only when "similar past cases" retrieval is
  built into Draft Reply.
- **Periodic Summary** (daily/weekly/monthly) writes to `daily_reports`.
- **Chat Agent** — the only true agent. READ-ONLY: retrieves from pgvector + `leads` + reports and
  answers the founder. It may *suggest* actions, but suggestions go INTO the approval queue; it
  never sends anything itself.

### Media studio — DEFERRED (Phase 5+)
Upload media or prompt→image-gen → hidden prompt enhancer → per-platform caption (few-shot, NOT
fine-tuned) → user edit → **approval** → multi-platform publisher. Do not start until the core
pipeline + Chat Agent are proven.

### Cross-cutting (applies to everything)
Tenant isolation (RLS) · `workflow_logs` observability · durable idempotency (`platform + message_id`) · AI cost tracking.

## 2. Current build state (grounded in code)

### Done / working
- Gmail OAuth + IMAP intake (`app/api/gmail/*`). *(Human is re-doing Google auth on the production
  domain — leave Gmail source wiring alone unless asked.)*
- Classification (WF2), reply drafting (WF3), follow-up scheduling (WF4), buy-back report (WF5) as
  n8n workflows — WF1/WF2/WF3/WF4/WF5 are all **active live** as of 2026-07-17 (second pass). WF3/WF4
  had been re-activation-blocked since the first 07-17 pass: their "Generate Reply/Follow-up
  Message" nodes used n8n's native OpenAI **Credential**, which was never bound (a different config
  surface from the `$vars.OPENAI_API_KEY` Variable used elsewhere) — n8n's `publish_workflow`
  rejected activation outright. Fixed by re-wiring both through the app's `/api/internal/n8n/ai/draft`
  endpoint (same pattern as WF2's classify call) instead of a native credential — see
  `n8n_logic/exports/README.md`. WF2 was also re-wired live to match: `Classify Message` now calls
  `/api/internal/n8n/ai/classify` and `Create Lead` calls `/api/internal/n8n/leads`, removing the
  direct `api.openai.com` call and the Supabase service-role write. **Caveat:** these live n8n
  workflows call `$vars.NEXUS_APP_URL` (production), but `main` is currently missing nearly the
  entire `/api/internal/n8n/*` surface these calls depend on (only 4 of ~20 endpoints exist there —
  see §4 note). They will 404 in production until `issue-fix2` is merged and deployed.
- Approval flow (`app/api/approval/route.ts`, `/approval` page).
- Multi-tenant model: `teams → workspaces → profiles → business_profiles`, RLS helpers
  (`private.current_team_id()`, `public.is_workspace_owner()`).
- Internal n8n ingest endpoints (`app/api/internal/n8n/*`) with `N8N_INGEST_TOKEN`. **On the
  `issue-fix2` branch only** — `main` currently ships just 4 of these routes (`conversations`,
  `gmail-credentials`, `meta-credentials`, `workflow-logs`); everything else (`ai/classify`,
  `ai/draft`, `ai/report-summary`, `leads`, `send-reply`, `outbound-jobs/*`, `scheduled-posts`,
  `social-credentials`, `gmail-sync`, `gmail-backfill`, `inbound-replay`, `inbound-record`,
  `autopilot-send`, `post-result`, `match-embeddings`, `ai-usage`) is unmerged. Every live n8n
  workflow above calls these by production URL — **merging + deploying `issue-fix2` is the single
  highest-priority manual step**; until then WF2/WF3/WF4/WF8b/WF8d/approval-send all 404 silently
  in production even though they're "active."
- Design tokens + 5 hand-built UI components (`components/ui/`). shadcn is configured in
  `components.json` but NOT installed (no Radix / CVA in package.json).
- **Knowledge layer + Chat Agent** (shipped 2026-07-14, detailed in §5) — pgvector `embeddings` +
  `business_documents`, read-only retrieval-backed Chat Agent at `/chat`.
- **Social publishing studio** (shipped 2026-07-09→15) — in-app OpenAI caption/image generation
  (`lib/posts/ai.ts`), manual/schedule/upload composer, WF8b (publish) + WF8d (scheduler, inactive
  until platform credentials bind) — see `n8n_logic/exports/README.md`. This was previously listed
  under "Deferred" below; that was stale.
- **Meta inbound durable ledger** (shipped 2026-06-24, Task 1/2 in §5) — `inbound_events` table,
  persist-before-ack, edge tenant resolution. Previously listed as a "half-built" weak spot below;
  that framing was stale — see the corrected list.

### Half-built — Meta unified inbox (≈70%)
Built:
- Migration `20260619120000_meta_unified_inbox_foundation.sql`:
  - `conversations.source` extended with `whatsapp` / `instagram` / `facebook`.
  - `conversations.external_thread_id`, `external_permalink` columns + index.
  - `business_profiles` routing keys `wa_phone_number_id`, `ig_account_id`, `fb_page_id` (unique).
  - `meta_credentials` table (encrypted token, platform, status, sync flags) with RLS + triggers.
- `app/api/meta/webhook/route.ts`: GET hub-challenge verify ✓, POST `X-Hub-Signature-256` verify ✓,
  message-id extraction for WhatsApp (`entry[].changes[].value.messages[]`) and Messenger/IG
  (`entry[].messaging[].message.mid`) ✓.
- OAuth: `app/api/meta/connect`, `/callback`, `/status`, `helpers.ts` (scopes, state encode/decode,
  graph URL). `lib/meta-deep-links.ts`. `app/api/internal/n8n/meta-credentials/route.ts`.
- `n8n_logic/multi_channel_normalizer.js`, `tenant_route_resolver.js`.

**Resolved since this was first written (see §5 Task 1/2, 2026-06-24):**
1. ~~Dedup is an in-memory `Map`~~ → durable `inbound_events` idempotency table shipped.
2. ~~n8n forward is fire-and-forget~~ → persist-before-ack shipped (`lib/inbound-events.ts`).

**Still NOT done / genuinely open weak spots:**
3. **Tenant routing not verified end-to-end** from a real Meta payload through
   `tenant_route_resolver.js` into a `conversations` row with correct `team_id`/`workspace_id` —
   blocked on Meta App Review (no real payloads to test against yet).
4. **Deep links unverified** — WhatsApp must link to the *customer* number, not the business
   number; IG/FB message ids are not always thread ids.
5. **Meta outbound sending** — code is real and complete (`lib/meta/send.ts`), but intentionally
   kill-switched behind `META_SEND_ENABLED` (unset by default) pending Meta App Review. Not a bug.

### Deferred (do not start yet)
Hiring / People Intelligence — specified, not yet built. Canonical plan + **Build checklist**:
`docs/NEXUS_OPERATING_LAYER_PLAN.md`. Implement one numbered partition per conversation. After
verify, tick that partition `[x]` in the checklist. Do not start Wave 2 until Wave 1 is complete.

---

## 3. Key tables (grep migrations to confirm columns; do not assume)

- `conversations` — inbound messages. `source`, `external_thread_id`, `external_permalink`,
  classification columns (added in 0002/0003).
- `leads` — classification output: intent, urgency, `estimated_value`, `risk_score`.
- `reply_drafts` — approval-gated drafts (status `pending_approval` etc.).
- `business_profiles` — tone/services/approval mode + routing keys (gmail destination, wa/ig/fb).
- `meta_credentials` / `gmail_credentials` — encrypted per-workspace tokens.
- `workflow_logs` — step audit trail.
- `daily_reports` — aggregated hours saved / revenue rescued.

---

## 4. Build order (functions track — owned by Senuka)

UI and pricing are owned by other members; this track is backend/functions.

1. ~~Reliability foundation~~ — **done** (durable `inbound_events` + idempotency, 2026-06-24).
2. **Meta inbound end-to-end:** verified tenant routing + normalizer → `conversations`; correct
   deep links; parser tests for WA/IG/FB payloads. ← still open, blocked on Meta App Review. ← NEXT
3. ~~Historical backfill on connect~~ — **done** (Gmail; WF0e Gmail Backfill, active).
4. ~~Knowledge layer~~ — **done** (2026-07-14, pgvector `embeddings` + business-doc ingestion).
5. ~~Chat Agent~~ — **done** (2026-07-14, read-only retrieval over docs + leads + reports).
6. **Meta outbound** (approval-gated, messaging-window rules) — code complete, kill-switched on
   `META_SEND_ENABLED` pending Meta App Review.
7. ~~Media studio / image gen~~ — **done** (social publishing studio, shipped 2026-07-09→15).
8. **People Intelligence** — `docs/NEXUS_OPERATING_LAYER_PLAN.md` Build checklist. One partition
   per conversation; tick `[x]` when verified. Wave 2 is forbidden until W1 is ticked.
9. Production-reliability hardening (durable queues, per-tenant
   `N8N_INGEST_TOKEN` scoping, replay tooling) is ongoing — see
   `docs/security_audit_and_review_2026-07-15.md` blocker #7.

Each step ships behind the existing safety model (RLS, approval gate, encrypted tokens) and ends
with the report-back block from `.cursor/rules/nexus.mdc`.

## 5. Decisions & known deferrals (do not re-litigate without reason)

- **Task 1 shipped (2026-06-24):** durable `inbound_events` ledger + idempotency
  (`20260620120000_inbound_events_idempotency.sql`), persist-before-ack webhook, reusable
  `lib/inbound-events.ts`. Migration must be applied in Supabase; runtime needs
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` or the webhook fail-safes to 503.
- **Delivery/read receipts** (Meta `statuses` / read events) are intentionally NOT forwarded today
  (returned `200 {ignored}`). They are NOT inbound customer messages. **MUST be handled in the Meta
  OUTBOUND task** to update `conversations.status` / `reply_drafts` (delivered/read). Don't forget.
- **No retry/replay sweep yet.** Webhook returns 200 after persist, so Meta will NOT redeliver a
  failed n8n forward. Events stuck at `received`/`failed` in `inbound_events` are durable but not
  reprocessed. A cron/worker draining them is **required before production launch** (not beta).
- **n8n inbound path** is `${N8N_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL}/webhook/gmail-inbound` for ALL channels
  (disambiguated by `x-nexus-channel` header). Rename to a channel-neutral path when n8n is touched.
- **Tenant resolution location:** resolve at the EDGE (Next.js webhook), not in n8n — so the
  `inbound_events` ledger is tenant-stamped at write time and routing lives in one typed place.
  (Adopted in Task 2.)
- **Task 2 shipped (2026-06-24):** edge tenant resolution (`lib/meta-tenant.ts`), ledger stamping,
  normalizer canonical fields + customer-number WhatsApp permalink, IG/FB return null (graceful
  "unavailable") instead of wrong links. Tested via sanitized WA/IG/FB fixtures. Real routing-key
  fields to be confirmed against live payloads once Meta App Review clears.
- **Knowledge layer NOW BUILT (2026-07-14).** Business-document upload — the agreed trigger for
  building the vector store — shipped, so the `embeddings`/pgvector layer is live. Migration
  `20260715120000_knowledge_layer_pgvector.sql` adds the `vector` extension, a single `embeddings`
  table tagged by `kind` (`business_doc` | `conversation` | `summary`), a `business_documents`
  metadata table, the `match_embeddings` cosine-search RPC, and a private `business-docs` storage
  bucket. The **Chat Agent** now retrieves relevant chunks (`lib/embeddings/store.ts` →
  `buildAnalystContext` → `buildAnalystSystemPrompt`) in addition to the structured snapshot;
  founders manage docs + an editable analyst persona in Settings → AI & Approval Rules. Ingestion
  is via `POST /api/business-docs` (extract → chunk → embed); chat/inbox summaries are embedded
  best-effort. It still answers ONLY from the snapshot + knowledge base (read-only, no fabrication).
- **Both Gmail and Meta are domain-blocked for live use** (production domain not finalized; Meta
  also needs App Review). So `conversations`/`leads` may be empty in dev — the Chat Agent task
  includes a demo-seed script so it can be built and demoed before live intake exists.
