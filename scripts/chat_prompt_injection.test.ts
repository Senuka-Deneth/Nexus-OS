/**
 * Prompt-injection canary tests for the Revenue Analyst
 * (lib/chat/system-prompt.ts + lib/chat/analyst-context.ts).
 * Run: npm run test:prompt-injection
 *
 * Customer-controlled text (inbound messages, retrieved knowledge chunks) flows
 * into the analyst's system prompt. These canaries assert the structural
 * defenses hold, deterministically and without a live LLM:
 *   1. The immutable RULES block is always present and complete, even when
 *      hostile text tries to impersonate or override it.
 *   2. Hostile knowledge chunks stay contained inside the KNOWLEDGE BASE
 *      section — they can never appear before the RULES block.
 *   3. Hostile customer messages are JSON-encoded inside the DATA SNAPSHOT, so
 *      fence/heading injection cannot break out of the JSON string.
 *   4. A founder-editable persona cannot displace the RULES (rules render after
 *      the persona, closest to the data).
 *   5. Retrieval is team-scoped by construction: match_embeddings is always
 *      called with the requesting team's id.
 *   6. A jailbreak asking to "update the employee" / email a candidate cannot
 *      displace the read-only People rules.
 *   7. Hostile candidate names in DATA SNAPSHOT.people stay JSON-encoded.
 *   8. People read-tool schema is the three G2 names; jailbreak cannot add tools.
 *   9. People propose-tool schema is the two G3 names; send_email is absent.
 * If any of these fail, hostile customer text has a path to rewrite the
 * analyst's ground rules — treat as a release blocker.
