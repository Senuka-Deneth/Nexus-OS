 * Static check (Task E.8): the critical UI + API routes this app depends on for founder-facing

 * silently deleting/renaming a page during a refactor (e.g. `/profile` being the settings
 * destination — see app/settings/page.tsx and app/api/meta/helpers.ts) without updating every
 * link/redirect that points at it.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:route-reference
